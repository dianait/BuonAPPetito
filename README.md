Create a tricky app to order pizzas!
If there is a recurrent software product, an online shop is one of them!

The aim of this Challenge is to create an amazing app that allows your business to handle orders from users who are starving for a perfect and yummy pizza! 🍕

Why is this app better than some actual ones? Clients do not need to register, they can order 4-halve pizzas (or even more!), they can remove some toppings and... a final trick to avoid paying 🫣

## 🛠 How does it work?
✅ When the user opens the app, the main list of pizzas shows up to allow them to pick one and start the order

✅ Each pizza can contain up to 5 toppings and a fixed price

✅ The user could add as many pizzas as they want to the shopping cart

✅ Through the main list, the user will see the detail page of the pizza to see their main ingredients, picture, or description

[ ] A pizza could be composed of 4 independent types! 🤯 So the user could do their own creation

## 🏡 Main screen
✅ Shows all the available pizzas, with its name, picture, and price

✅ Users can add any of them to the shopping cart

✅ Users can access the detail page just by clicking on any item

✅ Users can go to their shopping cart to see which pizzas they have added

## 🔍 Detail screen
✅ The app will show the picture, name, description price, and ingredients of the pizza

[ ] The user would be able to add it to their shopping cart

[ ] Through this screen, the user will be able to remove up to 2 toppings

[ ] The user can create a 4-halves pizza. So the app will show the selection process up to 4 times, allowing to remove up to 2 ingredients on each half

## 🛒 Shopping cart screen
Shows the selected pizzas

[ ] If the user has selected a by halves pizza, it has to be specified for each one

[ ] If the user has removed some ingredients from the pizza, it has to be shown

[ ] The user has some credits on the app, so they will be shown here. If the user has not had enough credits, they won't be able to end the purchase process

[ ] In case the user has enough credits, the app allows the user to purchase the selected pizzas!

🚨 But... what happens if you don't have enough credits on the app? 🥲 For every 5 clicks in a row the user does in the Total amount of the shopping cart, the system will add $20 to their credits!

## ⏭️ Extra points (optional)
Here you rule! 😎

You can add a screen to request the delivery info of the user

How are you going to charge the total amount? You can research PayPal, Stripe, or other payment methods
